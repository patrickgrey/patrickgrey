### Feature aim
When I search to filter posts on my site, I wanted to highlight the search term in the results so visitors can quickly see why that result was returned.

### Development notes
- Markjs.io
- Rejected vue as thought there must be lots of edge cases, hence library.
- Found an example that worked.
- Didn't realise it was vue v1 and that's why didn't work for me
- Found solution to adding a filter to raw HTML results.
