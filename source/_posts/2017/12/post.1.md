It&#39;s the build up to Christmas, hooray!! A special season when I get to stay up late and learn some new tech, sometime in between the pint of sherry kicking in and the kids waking up.

I love restarting my website from scratch (again). A blank canvas. A chance to do it right this time. I won&#39;t. A chance to over-engineer the hell out of a simple website in order to practice all the new things I want to learn.

### A thirst for <span class="pg-strikethrough">sherry</span> knowledge

A few things I want to learn:

- Vue.js
- Progressive Web Apps
- Continuous Delivery/Deployment

A few things I want to improve:
- Accessibility
- Security
- Visual code familiarity
- Adobe After Effect - keeping my career options open :-)

### patrickgrey.co.uk 2.0.0 - the Origin Story

I've sketched out a roadmap of how I see this website progressing:

0.0.1 Brutally simple website design &#9989;
- Aiming for decent performance and accessibility audit scores.
- Designed in the browser, mobile first.
- CSS still took bloody ages. It's hard.

0.0.2 Set up a local Static Site Generator &#9989;
- I like the speed and security aspects of this approach.
- I looked at [https://nuxtent.now.sh/guide](https://nuxtent.now.sh/guide) for a static blog generator but woah, that seems overly complicated for what it&#39;s meant to do. [https://hexo.io/](https://hexo.io/) is stable and quick for a simple blog.

0.0.3 Firebase hosting
0.0.4 Continuous Dev Accessibility and performance audits

Future posts will be shorter and more focusses. Sherry allowing.
