title: Firebase hosting
date: 2017/12/11

Log into the console at: https://console.firebase.google.com

Add a new project. I like to give it a long enough title so that there isn't a randomly generated suffix. So, instead of patrickgrey-09CG5 I used patrickgrey-production.

Select the project and then hosting.

Open terminal (http://cmder.net/ in my case) and enter
```
npm install -g firebase-tools
```
Test

```javascript
function test (_x) {
    var x = 0;
    return x;
}
```
