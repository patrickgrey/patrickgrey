It&#39;s the build up to Christmas, hooray!! A special season when I get to stay up late and learn some new tech, sometime in between the pint of sherry kicking in and the kids waking up.

I love restarting my website from scratch (again). A blank canvas. A chance to do it right this time. I won&#39;t. A chance to over-engineer the hell out of a simple website in order to practice all the new things I want to learn.

### A thirst for <span class="pg-strikethrough">sherry</span> knowledge

A few things I want to explore in more depth:

- Vue.js
- Progressive Web Apps
- Continuous Delivery/Deployment
- Accessibility
- Security
- Visual code familiarity
- Adobe After Effect - keeping my career options open :-)

Courses I'm hoping to take:

- [Wes Bos](http://wesbos.com/courses/) ES6 for Everyone
- Ula
- Vue school

### patrickgrey.co.uk 2.0.0 - the Origin Story

I've sketched out a road-map of how I see this website progressing:

- [x] 0.0.1 Brutally simple website design
- [x] 0.0.2 Set up a local Static Site Generator
- [ ] 0.0.3 Firebase hosting
- [ ] 0.0.4 Continuous Dev Accessibility and performance audits
- [ ] 0.0.5 Add search posts function
